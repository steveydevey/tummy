# Mobile-First Design Standards

## Overview

This application is designed as a **mobile-first** application. All design decisions, UI components, and user experience considerations must prioritize mobile device usage.

## Core Principles

1. **Mobile-First Approach**: Design for mobile devices first, then enhance for larger screens
2. **Touch-Friendly**: All interactive elements must be easily tappable on mobile devices
3. **Responsive Layout**: Ensure the application works well on all screen sizes
4. **Performance**: Optimize for mobile network conditions and device capabilities

## Design Guidelines

### Layout & Spacing
- Use flexible layouts that adapt to small screens
- Ensure adequate spacing between interactive elements (minimum 44x44px touch targets)
- Avoid fixed-width elements that don't work on small screens
- Use single-column layouts on mobile when possible

### Typography
- Use readable font sizes (minimum 16px for body text to prevent auto-zoom on iOS)
- Ensure sufficient line height for readability on small screens
- Use relative units (rem, em) rather than fixed pixels where appropriate

### Forms & Inputs
- Make form fields full-width on mobile
- Use appropriate input types (date, time, email, etc.) for mobile keyboards
- Ensure form fields are large enough for easy interaction
- Group related fields logically
- Provide clear labels and error messages

### Navigation
- Keep navigation simple and accessible
- Use touch-friendly button sizes
- Consider bottom navigation for frequently accessed items
- Ensure navigation works with thumb-reach zones

### Tables & Lists
- Consider card-based layouts instead of tables on mobile
- If tables are necessary, make them horizontally scrollable or stack columns
- Use clear visual hierarchy

### Images & Media
- Optimize images for mobile bandwidth
- Use responsive images that scale appropriately
- Ensure images don't break layout on small screens

### Colors & Contrast
- Ensure sufficient color contrast for readability
- Test on various screen brightness levels
- Consider dark mode compatibility

### Performance
- Minimize HTTP requests
- Optimize CSS and JavaScript
- Use lazy loading where appropriate
- Test on slower network connections

## Implementation Notes

- All new UI components should be tested on mobile devices or mobile emulators
- When in doubt, prioritize mobile usability over desktop features
- Consider progressive enhancement: start with mobile, enhance for larger screens
- Use CSS media queries with mobile-first approach (min-width, not max-width)

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Test on actual mobile devices (iOS and Android)
- [ ] Verify touch targets are adequately sized
- [ ] Check form usability on mobile keyboards
- [ ] Test navigation with one-handed use
- [ ] Verify readability on small screens
- [ ] Test performance on slower connections
- [ ] Check horizontal scrolling behavior
- [ ] Verify all interactive elements are accessible
